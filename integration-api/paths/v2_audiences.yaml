  summary: Create audience
  description: >
    Create an audience. The audience can be created directly from scratch or can
    come from third party platforms.


    **Note:** Audiences can also be created from scratch via the Campaign
    Manager. See the
    [docs](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/audiences/creating-audiences).


    To create an audience from an existing audience from a [technology
    partner](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/technology-partners/overview):

    1. Set the `integration` property to `mparticle`, `segment` etc., depending
    on a third-party platform.

    1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in a third-party platform.


    To create an audience from an existing audience in another platform:

    1. Do not use the `integration` property.

    1. Set `integrationId` to the ID of this audience in the 3rd-party platform.


    To create an audience from scratch:

    1. Only set the `name` property.


    Once you create your first audience, audience-specific rule conditions are
    enabled in the Rule Builder.
