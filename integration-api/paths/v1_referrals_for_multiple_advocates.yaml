  summary: Create referral codes for multiple advocates
  description: >

    for the referral campaign for which it is created, indicated in the
    `campaignId` parameter, and one referral code will be associated with one
    advocate using the profile specified in the `advocateProfileIntegrationId`
    parameter as the advocate's profile.


    **Note:** Any [referral
    limits](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/settings/managing-campaign-budgets#referral-limits)
    set are ignored when you use this endpoint.
