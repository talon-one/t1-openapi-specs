                      - `add`: Adds the customer profile to the audience.

                        **Note**: If the customer profile does not exist, it will be created. The profile will not be visible in any Application
                        until a session or profile update is received for that profile.
                      - `delete`: Removes the customer profile from the
                      audience.
                    example: add
