  summary: Update multiple customer profiles
  description: >
    Update (or create) up to 1000 [customer
    profiles](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-profiles)
    in 1 request.


    The `integrationId` must be any identifier that remains stable for

    the customer. Do not use an ID that the customer can update

    themselves. For example, you can use a database ID.


    A customer profile [can be linked to one or more
    sessions](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-sessions).


    **Note:** This endpoint does not trigger the Rule Engine. To trigger the
    Rule Engine for customer profile updates,

    use the [Update customer
    profile](#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfileV2) endpoint.
