  summary: Update customer session
  description: >
    Update or create a [customer
    session](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions).

    The endpoint responds with the potential promotion rule
    [effects](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects) that
    match the current cart.

    For example, use this endpoint to share the contents of a customer's cart
    with Talon.One.


    **Note:** 

    - The currency for the session and the cart items in it is the currency set
    for the Application linked to this session. - [Archived
    campaigns](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/managing-campaigns#archiving-a-campaign)
    are not considered for rule evaluation.


    ### Session management


    To use this endpoint, start by learning about [customer
    sessions](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions)

    and their states and refer to the `state` parameter documentation the
    request body schema docs below.


    ### Sessions and customer profiles


    - To link a session to a customer profile, set the `profileId` parameter in
    the request body to a customer profile's `integrationId`.

    - While you can create an anonymous session with `profileId=""`, we
    recommend you use a guest ID instead.

    - A profile can be linked to simultaneous sessions in different
    Applications. Either:
      - Use unique session integration IDs or,
      - Use the same session integration ID across all of the Applications.

    **Note:** If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is
    **created automatically**.
      You can update it with [Update customer profile](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-profiles/operation/updateCustomerProfileV2).

    <div class="redoc-section">
      <p class="title">Performance tips</p>

      - Updating a customer session returns a response with the new integration state. Use the `responseContent` property to save yourself extra API calls.
        For example, you can get the customer profile details directly without extra requests.
      - We recommend sending requests sequentially. See [Managing parallel requests](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/getting-started/integration-tutorial#managing-parallel-requests).

        Indicates whether to persist the changes. Changes are ignored when
        `dry=true`.


        When set to `true`:

        - The endpoint considers **only** the payload that you pass when
        **closing** the session.
          When you do not use the `dry` parameter, the endpoint behaves as a typical PUT endpoint. Each update builds upon the previous ones.
        - You can use the `evaluableCampaignIds` body property to select
        specific campaigns to run.

        You can see existing customer session integration IDs in the Campaign
        Manager's **Sessions** menu, or via the

        [List Application
        session](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#operation/getApplicationSessions)

        Use this parameter, for example, to test campaigns that would be
        evaluated for this customer session in the future (say, [scheduled
        campaigns](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/settings/managing-campaign-schedule)).


        **Note:**


        - It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - It can **only** be a date in the future.

        - It can **only** be used if the `dry` parameter in the query is set to
        `true`.

                        For example, you can use IP addresses as identifiers to
                        potentially identify devices

                        and limit discounts abuse in case of customers creating
                        multiple accounts.

                        [tutorial](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/tutorials/using-identifiers).


                        **Important**: Ensure the session contains an identifier
                        by the time you close it if:

                        for your campaign.

                        - Your campaign has
                        [coupons](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/coupons/coupon-page-overview).

                              **Important**: Ensure the session contains an
                              identifier by the time you close it if:

                              - You [create a unique identifier
                              budget](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/settings/managing-campaign-budgets/#budget-types)

                              for your campaign.

                              - Your campaign has
                              [coupons](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/coupons/coupon-page-overview).

                              - We recommend passing an anonymized (hashed)
                              version of the identifier value.

                              Use this property to set a value for the
                              attributes of your choice. Attributes represent
                              any information to attach to your session, like
                              the shipping city.


                              You can use [built-in
                              attributes](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#built-in-attributes)
                              or [custom
                              ones](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes).

                              Custom attributes must be created in the Campaign
                              Manager before you set them with this property.
                            example:

                              on or use inside your rules.


                              For example, you can use IP addresses as
                              identifiers to potentially identify devices

                              and limit discounts abuse in case of customers
                              creating multiple accounts.

                              See the
                              [tutorial](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/tutorials/using-identifiers).


                              **Important**: Ensure the session contains an
                              identifier by the time you close it if:

                              - You [create a unique identifier

                              for your campaign.

                              - Your campaign has
                              [coupons](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/coupons/coupon-page-overview).

                              - We recommend passing an anonymized (hashed)
                              version of the identifier value.

                              Use this property to set a value for the
                              attributes of your choice. Attributes represent
                              any information to attach to your session, like
                              the shipping city.


                              You can use [built-in

                              or [custom
                              ones](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes).

                              Custom attributes must be created in the Campaign
                              Manager before you set them with this property.
