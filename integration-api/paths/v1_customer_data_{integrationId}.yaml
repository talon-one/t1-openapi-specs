  summary: Delete customer's personal data
  description: >
    Delete all attributes on the customer profile and on entities that reference
    this customer profile.


    **Important:**

    - Customer data is deleted from all Applications in the
    [environment](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/applications/overview#application-environments)
      that the API key belongs to. For example, if you use this endpoint with an API key that belongs to a sandbox Application,
      customer data will be deleted from all sandbox Applications. This is because customer data is shared
      between Applications from the same environment.
    - To preserve performance, we recommend avoiding deleting customer data
    during peak-traffic hours.

        The integration ID of the customer profile. You can get the
        `integrationId` of a profile using:

        - A customer session integration ID with the [Update customer
        session](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2)
        endpoint.

        - The Management API with the [List application's
        customers](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#operation/getApplicationCustomers)
        endpoint.
