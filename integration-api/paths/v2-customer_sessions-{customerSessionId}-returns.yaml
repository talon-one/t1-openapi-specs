    This endpoint automatically changes the session state from `closed` to
    `partially_returned`.


    **Note:** This will roll back any effects associated with these cart items.

    states](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions#customer-session-states)

                              on or use inside your rules.


                              For example, you can use IP addresses as
                              identifiers to potentially identify devices

                              and limit discounts abuse in case of customers
                              creating multiple accounts.

                              See the

                              **Important**: Ensure the session contains an
                              identifier by the time you close it if:

                              - You [create a unique identifier

                              for your campaign.

                              - Your campaign has
                              [coupons](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/coupons/coupon-page-overview).

                              - We recommend passing an anonymized (hashed)
                              version of the identifier value.

                              Use this property to set a value for the
                              attributes of your choice. Attributes represent
                              any information to attach to your session, like
                              the shipping city.


                              You can use [built-in

                              or [custom
                              ones](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes).

                              Custom attributes must be created in the Campaign
                              Manager before you set them with this property.
