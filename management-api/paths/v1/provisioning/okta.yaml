    Validate the ownership of the API through a challenge-response mechanism.


    This challenger endpoint is used by Okta to confirm that communication
    between Talon.One and Okta is correctly configured and accessible

    for provisioning and deprovisioning of Talon.One users, and that only
    Talon.One can receive and respond to events from Okta.
