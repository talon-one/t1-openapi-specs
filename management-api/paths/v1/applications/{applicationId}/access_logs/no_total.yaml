        **Note:**

        - This must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - You can include a time component in your string, for example,
        `T23:59:59` to specify the end of the day. The time zone setting
        considered is `UTC`. If you do not include a time component, a default
        time value of `T00:00:00` (midnight) in `UTC` is considered.
