    Retrieve loyalty program transaction logs in a given loyalty program with
    filtering options applied. Manual and imported transactions are also
    included.

    **Note:** If no filters are applied, the last 50 loyalty transactions for
    the given loyalty program are returned.


    **Important:** To get loyalty transaction logs for a given Integration ID in
    a loyalty program,

    we recommend using the Integration API's [Get customer's loyalty
    logs](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/getLoyaltyProgramProfileTransactions).
