  summary: Import customers into loyalty tiers
  description: >
    <div class="redoc-warning small">Management API endpoints are <b>not</b>
    meant to be used in real-time integrations that directly serve your end
    users. Rate limit: 3 requests per second.</div>


    Upload a CSV file containing existing customers to be assigned to existing
    tiers.

    Send the file as multipart data.


    **Important:** This endpoint only works with loyalty programs with advanced
    tiers (with expiration and downgrade policy) feature enabled.


    The CSV file should contain the following columns:

    - `subledgerid` (optional): The ID of the subledger. If this field is empty,
    the main ledger will be used.

    - `customerprofileid`: The integration ID of the customer profile to whom
    the tier should be assigned.

    - `tiername`: The name of an existing tier to assign to the customer.

    - `expirydate`: The expiration date of the tier when the tier is
    reevaluated. It should be a future date.


    About customer assignment to a tier:

    - If the customer isn't already in a tier, the customer is assigned to the
    specified tier during the tier import.

    - If the customer is already in the tier that's specified in the CSV file,
    only the expiration date is updated.


    **Note:** We recommend not using this endpoint to update the tier of a
    customer.

    To update a customer's tier, you can
    [add](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/addLoyaltyPoints) or
    [deduct](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/removeLoyaltyPoints) their
    loyalty points.


    You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally
    by Talon.One.


    **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.
