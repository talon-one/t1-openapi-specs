  summary: Import giveaway codes into a giveaway pool

    Upload a CSV file containing the giveaway codes that should be created. Send
    the file as multipart data.


    The CSV file contains the following columns:

    - `code` (required): The code of your giveaway, for instance, a gift card
    redemption code.

    - `startdate`:  The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.

    - `enddate`: The last date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period.

    - `attributes`: A JSON object describing _custom_ giveaway attribute names
    and their values, enclosed with double quotation marks.

      For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)
      called `provider` associated with the giveaway entity, the object in the CSV file, when opened in a text editor, must be: `"{"provider": "myPartnerCompany"}"`.

    The `startdate` and `enddate` have nothing to do with the _validity_ of the
    codes. They are only used by the Rule Engine to award the codes or not.

    You can use the time zone setting of your choice. The values are converted
    to UTC internally by Talon.One.


    **Note:**


    - We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.

    - You can import the same code multiple times. Duplicate codes are treated
    and distributed to customers as unique codes.


    **Example:**


    ```text

    code,startdate,enddate,attributes

    GIVEAWAY1,2020-11-10T23:00:00Z,2022-11-11T23:00:00Z,"{""provider"":
    ""Amazon""}"

    GIVEAWAY2,2020-11-10T23:00:00Z,2022-11-11T23:00:00Z,"{""provider"":
    ""Amazon""}"

    GIVEAWAY3,2021-01-10T23:00:00Z,2022-11-11T23:00:00Z,"{""provider"":
    ""Aliexpress""}"
