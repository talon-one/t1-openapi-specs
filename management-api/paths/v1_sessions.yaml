    Create a session to use the Management API endpoints.

    Use the value of the `token` property provided in the response as bearer
    token in other API calls.


    A token is valid for 3 months. In accordance with best pratices, use your
    generated token

    for all your API requests. Do **not** regenerate a token for each request.


    This endpoint has a rate limit of 3 to 6 requests per second per account,
    depending on your setup.


    <div class="redoc-section">
      <p class="title">Granular API key</p>
      Instead of using a session, you can also use the <a href="https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-mapi-keys">Management API key feature</a>
      in the Campaign Manager to decide which endpoints can be used with a given key.
