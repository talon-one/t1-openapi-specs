    Deduct points from the specified loyalty program and specified customer
    profile.


    **Important:**

    - Only active points can be deducted.

    - Only pending points are rolled back when a session is cancelled or
    reopened.


    To get the `integrationId` of the profile from a `sessionId`, use the

    [Update customer
    session](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2)
    endpoint.
