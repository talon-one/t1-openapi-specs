    Download a CSV file containing the loyalty cards from a specified loyalty

    - `created`: The date and time the loyalty card was created.

    - `status`: The status of the loyalty card.

    - `userpercardlimit`: The maximum number of customer profiles that can be
    linked to the card.

    - `customerprofileids`: Integration IDs of the customer profiles linked to
    the card.

    - `blockreason`: The reason for transferring and blocking the loyalty card.

    - `generated`: An indicator of whether the loyalty card was generated.
