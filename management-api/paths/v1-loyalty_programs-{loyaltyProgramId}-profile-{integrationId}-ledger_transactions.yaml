    Retrieve paginated results of loyalty transaction logs for the given
    Integration ID in the specified loyalty program.


    You can filter transactions by date or by ledger (subledger or main ledger).
    If no filters are applied, the last 50 loyalty transactions for the given
    integration ID are returned.


    **Note:** To retrieve all loyalty program transaction logs in a given
    loyalty program,

    use the [List loyalty program
    transactions](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/getLoyaltyProgramTransactions)
    endpoint.

        The integration identifier for this customer profile. Must be:

        - Unique within the deployment.

        - Stable for the customer. Do not use an ID that the customer can update
        themselves. For example, you can use a database ID.


        Once set, you cannot update this identifier.
