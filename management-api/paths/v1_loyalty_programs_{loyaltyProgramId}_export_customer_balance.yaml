    <div class="redoc-warning small">Management API endpoints are <b>not</b>
    meant to be used in real-time integrations that directly serve your end
    users. Rate limit: 3 requests per second.</div>


    ⚠️ Deprecation notice: Support for requests to this endpoint will end soon.

    To export customer loyalty balances to CSV, use the [Export customer loyalty
    balances to
    CSV](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/exportLoyaltyBalances) endpoint.


    Download a CSV file containing the balance of each customer in the loyalty
    program.


    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).
  tags:
    - Loyalty
  parameters:
    - name: loyaltyProgramId

        Used to return expired, active, and pending loyalty balances before this
        timestamp. You can enter any past, present, or future timestamp value.


        **Note:**


        - It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - You can include a time component in your string, for example,
        `T23:59:59` to specify the end of the day. The time zone setting
        considered is `UTC`. If you do not include a time component, a default
        time value of `T00:00:00` (midnight) in `UTC` is considered.
