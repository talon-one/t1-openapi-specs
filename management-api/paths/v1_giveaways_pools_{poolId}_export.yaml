    <div class="redoc-warning small">Management API endpoints are <b>not</b>
    meant to be used in real-time integrations that directly serve your end
    users. Rate limit: 3 requests per second.</div>


    Download a CSV file containing the giveaway codes of a specific giveaway
    pool.


    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).


    The CSV file contains the following columns:


    - `id`: The internal ID of the giveaway.

    - `poolid`: The internal ID of the giveaway pool.

    - `code`: The giveaway code.

    - `startdate`: The validity start date in RFC3339 of the giveaway (can be
    empty).

    - `enddate`: The validity end date in RFC3339 of the giveaway (can be
    empty).

    - `attributes`: Any custom attributes associated with the giveaway code (can
    be empty).

    - `used`: An indication of whether the giveaway is already awarded.

    - `importid`: The ID of the import which created the giveaway.

    - `created`: The creation time of the giveaway code.

    - `profileintegrationid`: The third-party integration ID of the customer
    profile that was awarded the giveaway. Can be empty if the giveaway was not
    awarded.

    - `profileid`: The internal ID of the customer profile that was awarded the
    giveaway. Can be empty if the giveaway was not awarded or an internal ID
    does not exist.
