                            The time format is a number followed by one letter
                            indicating the time unit, like '30s', '40m', '1h',
                            '5D', '7W', or 10M'. These rounding suffixes are
                            also supported:

                            - '_D' for rounding down. Can be used as a suffix
                            after 'D', and signifies the start of the day.

                            - '_U' for rounding up. Can be used as a suffix
                            after 'D', 'W', and 'M', and signifies the end of

                              - `not_join`: The customer does not join the loyalty program but can still earn and spend loyalty points.

                                 **Note**: The customer does not have a program join date.
                              - `points_activated`: The customer joins the loyalty program only when their earned loyalty points become active for the first time.
                              - `points_earned`: The customer joins the loyalty program when they earn loyalty points for the first time.

                            reevaluate the customer's current tier, is
                            determined.
                             - `tier_start_date`: The tier expiration is relative to when the customer joined the current tier.
                             - `program_join_date`: The tier expiration is relative to when the customer joined the loyalty program.
                             - `customer_attribute`: The tier expiration is determined by a custom customer attribute.
                             - `absolute_expiration`: The tier is reevaluated at the start of each tier cycle. For this policy, it is required to provide a `tierCycleStartDate`.

                            customers in the loyalty program.


                            **Note**: This is only required when the tier
                            expiration policy is set to `absolute_expiration`.

                            is reevaluated.


                            The time format is an **integer** followed by one
                            letter indicating the time unit.

                            Examples: `30s`, `40m`, `1h`, `5D`, `7W`, `10M`,
                            `15Y`.


                            Available units:


                            - `s`: seconds

                            - `m`: minutes

                            - `h`: hours

                            - `D`: days

                            - `Y`: years


                            You can round certain units up or down:

                            - `_D` for rounding down days only. Signifies the
                            start of the day.

                            - `_U` for rounding up days, weeks, months and
                            years. Signifies the end of the day, week, month or
                            year.

                             - `one_down`: If the customer doesn't have enough points to stay in the current tier, they are downgraded by one tier.
                             - `balance_based`: The customer's tier is reevaluated based on the amount of active points they have at the moment.
