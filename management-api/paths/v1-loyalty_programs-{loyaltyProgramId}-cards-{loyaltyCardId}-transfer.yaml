    Transfer loyalty card data, such as linked customers, loyalty balances and
    transactions, from a given loyalty card to a new, automatically created
    loyalty card.


    **Important:**


    - The original card is automatically blocked once the new card is created,
    and it cannot be activated again.

    - The default status of the new card is _active_.
