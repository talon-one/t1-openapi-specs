    Download a CSV file containing the balance of each customer in the loyalty
    program.


    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).


    The generated file can contain the following columns:


    - `loyaltyProgramID`: The ID of the loyalty program.

    - `loyaltySubledger`: The name of the subdleger, when applicatble.

    - `profileIntegrationID`: The integration ID of the customer profile.

    - `currentBalance`: The current point balance.

    - `pendingBalance`: The number of pending points.

    - `expiredBalance`: The number of expired points.

    - `spentBalance`: The number of spent points.

    - `currentTier`: The tier that the customer is in at the time of the export.

        Used to return expired, active, and pending loyalty balances before this
        timestamp. You can enter any past, present, or future timestamp value.


        **Note:**


        - It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - You can include a time component in your string, for example,
        `T23:59:59` to specify the end of the day. The time zone setting
        considered is `UTC`. If you do not include a time component, a default
        time value of `T00:00:00` (midnight) in `UTC` is considered.
