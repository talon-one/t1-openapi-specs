    Download a CSV file containing the balances of all cards in the loyalty

    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).

    - `loyaltyProgramID`: The ID of the loyalty program.

    - `loyaltySubledger`: The name of the subdleger, when applicatble.

    - `cardIdentifier`: The alphanumeric identifier of the loyalty card.

    - `cardState`:The state of the loyalty card. It can be `active` or
    `inactive`.

    - `currentBalance`: The current point balance.

    - `pendingBalance`: The number of pending points.

    - `expiredBalance`: The number of expired points.

    - `spentBalance`: The number of spent points.

        Used to return expired, active, and pending loyalty balances before this
        timestamp. You can enter any past, present, or future timestamp value.


        **Note:**


        - It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - You can include a time component in your string, for example,
        `T23:59:59` to specify the end of the day. The time zone setting
        considered is `UTC`. If you do not include a time component, a default
        time value of `T00:00:00` (midnight) in `UTC` is considered.
