  summary: Import allowed values for attribute

    meant to be used in real-time integrations that directly serve your end
    users. Rate limit: 3 requests per second.</div>


    Upload a CSV file containing a list of [picklist
    values](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/account/dev-tools/managing-attributes#picklist-values)
    for the specified attribute.


    The file should be sent as multipart data.


    The import **replaces** the previous list of allowed values for this
    attribute, if any.


    The CSV file **must** only contain the following column:

    - `item` (required): the values in your allowed list, for example a list of
    SKU's.


    An allowed list is limited to 500,000 items.


    Example:


    ```text

    item

    CS-VG-04032021-UP-50D-10

    CS-DV-04042021-UP-49D-12

    CS-DG-02082021-UP-50G-07

    ```
