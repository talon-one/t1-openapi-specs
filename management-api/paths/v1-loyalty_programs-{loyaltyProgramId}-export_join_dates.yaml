    Download a CSV file containing the join dates of all customers in the

    The generated file can contain the following columns:


    - `loyaltyProgramID`: The ID of the loyalty program.

    - `profileIntegrationID`: The integration ID of the customer profile.

    - `joinDate`: The customer's loyalty program join date in RFC3339 format.
