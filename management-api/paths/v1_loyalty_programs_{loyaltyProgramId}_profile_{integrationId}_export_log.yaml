    Download a CSV file containing a customer's transaction logs in the loyalty
    program.


    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).


    The generated file can contain the following columns:


    - `customerprofileid`: The ID of the profile.

    - `customersessionid`: The ID of the customer session.

    - `rulesetid`: The ID of the rule set.

    - `rulename`: The name of the rule.

    - `programid`: The ID of the loyalty program.

    - `type`: The transaction type, such as `addition` or `subtraction`.

    - `name`: The reason for the transaction.

    - `subledgerid`: The ID of the subledger, when applicable.

    - `startdate`: The start date of the program.

    - `expirydate`: The expiration date of the program.

    - `id`: The ID of the transaction.

    - `created`: The timestamp of the creation of the loyalty program.

    - `amount`: The number of points in that transaction.

    - `archived`: Whether the session related to the transaction is archived.

    - `campaignid`: The ID of the campaign.

    - `flags`: The flags of the transaction, when applicable. The
    `createsNegativeBalance` flag indicates whether the transaction results in a
    negative balance.

    - `transactionUUID`: Unique identifier of the transaction in the UUID
    format.

        **Note:**

        - This must be an RFC3339 timestamp string.

        - You can include a time component in your string, for example,
        `T23:59:59` to specify the end of the day. The time zone setting
        considered is `UTC`. If you do not include a time component, a default
        time value of `T00:00:00` (midnight) in `UTC` is considered.
