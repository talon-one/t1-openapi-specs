    Upload a CSV file containing the loyalty points you want to import into a
    given loyalty program.

    Send the file as multipart data.


    Depending on the type of loyalty program, you can import points into a given
    customer profile or loyalty card.


    The CSV file contains the following columns:


    - `customerprofileid` (optional): For profile-based loyalty programs, the
    integration ID of the customer profile where the loyalty points are
    imported.

      **Note**: If the customer profile does not exist, it will be created. The profile will not be visible in any Application
      until a session or profile update is received for that profile.
    - `identifier` (optional): For card-based loyalty programs, the identifier
    of the loyalty card where the loyalty points are imported.

    - `amount`: The amount of points to award to the customer profile.

    - `startdate` (optional): The earliest date when the points can be redeemed.
    The points are `active` from this date until the expiration date.

      This parameter accepts one of the following values:
      - A timestamp string in RFC3339 format.
      - `immediate`
      - `on_action`
      
      **Note**:
      Empty or missing values default to `immediate`.
    - `expirydate` (optional): The latest date when the points can be redeemed.
    The points are `expired` after this date.

      **Note**: It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string or string `unlimited`. Empty or missing values are considered `unlimited`.
    - `subledgerid` (optional): The ID of the subledger that should received the
    points.

    - `reason` (optional): The reason why these points are awarded.


    You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally
    by Talon.One.


    **Note:** For existing customer profiles and loyalty cards, the imported
    points are added to any previous active or pending points, depending on the

    value provided for `startdate`. If `startdate` matches the current date, the
    imported points are _active_. If it is later, the points are _pending_ until

    the date provided for `startdate` is reached.


    **Note:** We recommend limiting your file size to 500MB.


    **Example for profile-based programs:**

    ```


    **Example for card-based programs:**
