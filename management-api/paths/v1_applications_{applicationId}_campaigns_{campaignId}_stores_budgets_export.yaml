    Download a CSV file containing the store budgets for a given campaign.


    **Tip:** If the exported CSV file is too large to view, you can [split it
    into multiple
    files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-split-a-huge-csv-excel-workbook-into-seperate-files/).


    The CSV file contains the following columns:


    - `store_integration_id`: The identifier of the store.

    - `limit`: The budget limit for the store.
