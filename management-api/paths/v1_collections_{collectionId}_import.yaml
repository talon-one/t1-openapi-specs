  summary: Import data into existing account-level collection

    Upload a CSV file containing the collection of string values that should be
    attached as payload for collection.

    The file should be sent as multipart data.


    The import **replaces** the initial content of the collection.


    The CSV file **must** only contain the following column:


    - `item`: the values in your collection.


    A collection is limited to 500,000 items.


    Example:


    ```

    item

    Addidas

    Nike

    Asics

    ```


    **Note:** Before sending a request to this endpoint, ensure the data in the
    CSV to import is different from the data currently stored in the collection.
