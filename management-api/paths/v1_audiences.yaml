        The field by which results should be sorted. By default, results are
        sorted in ascending order. To sort them in descending order, prefix the
        field name with `-`.


        **Note:** You may not be able to use all fields for sorting. This is due
        to performance limitations.
      example: name
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: withTotalResultSize
      in: query
      description: >
        When this flag is set, the result includes the total size of the result,
        across all pages. This might decrease performance on large data sets.


        - When `true`: `hasMore` is true when there is a next page.
        `totalResultSize` is always zero.

        - When `false`: `hasMore` is always false. `totalResultSize` contains
        the total number of results for this query.

                                For example, `mParticle`, `Segment`, `Shopify`,
                                `Braze`, or `Iterable`.


                                **Note:** If you do not integrate with any of
                                these platforms, do not use this property.

                                **Note:** To create an audience that doesn't
                                come from a 3rd party platform, do not use this
