  summary: Coupons created asynchronously
  tags:

  requestBody:

      The
      [notification](/docs/product/applications/application-notifications/overview)
      indicating that up to 5 million coupons were created asynchronously via
      the [Create coupons
      asynchronously](/management-api#tag/Coupons/operation/createCouponsAsync)
      endpoint.


      In this case, instead of individual notifications for specific coupon
      changes (such as creation, update, or deletion), a single notification
      about the completion of the batch processing of coupons with details about
      the batch is sent.


      **Tip:**

      To retrieve information about the generated coupons, after receiving the
      notification, use the [Export
      coupons](/management-api#tag/Coupons/operation/exportCoupons) endpoint
      along with the `batchid`, which indicates the batch to which the coupons
      belong.
